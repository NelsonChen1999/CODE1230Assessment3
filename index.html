     <h2>Problem</h2>
     <h3>The dataset that was analysed was what languages people spoke who moved to New South Wales from other countries.
     From the analysis, it was discovered that people who were weak at speaking English, but spoke another language lived in western and south-western Sydney, while people who only spoke english primarily lived in nothern Sydney.
     this can be seen in the following map, where the height of extrusions show the people who are weak at speaking english and the colour show the people who speak only english(the brighter the colour the more people in the area).</h3>
