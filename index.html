     <h2>Problem</h2>
     <h3>The dataset that was analysed was what languages people spoke who moved to New South Wales from other countries.
     From the analysis, it was discovered that people who were weak at speaking English, but spoke another language lived in western and south-western Sydney, while people who only spoke english primarily lived in nothern Sydney.
     This can be seen in the following map, where the height of extrusions show the people who are weak at speaking english and the colour show the people who speak only english(the brighter the colour the more people in the area).</h3>

     <h3>This was then compared with another dataset, which was the amount of weekly income a household gets. From this dataset it was discovered that people in western and south-western Sydney have more households that have a weekly income of $650-$799, whilst people in nothern Sydney have more households with a weekly income of over $4000.
       This can be seen in the following map, where the height of the extrusions show the number households with a weekly income of $650-$799 (the higher the extrusion the more households in the area), while the colours show the number of households with an income of over $4000 (with the brighter colours being where more households are).
