     <h2>Problem</h2>
     <h3>The dataset that was analysed was what languages people spoke who moved to New South Wales from other countries.
     From the analysis, it was discovered that people who were weak at speaking English, but spoke another language lived in western and south-western Sydney, while people who only spoke english primarily lived in nothern Sydney.
     This can be seen in the following map, where the height of extrusions show the people who are weak at speaking english and the colour show the people who speak only english(the brighter the colour the more people in the area).</h3>

     </h3>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h3>This was then compared with another dataset, which was the amount of weekly income a household gets. From this dataset it was discovered that people in western and south-western Sydney have more households that have a weekly income of $650-$799, whilst people in nothern Sydney have more households with a weekly income of over $4000.
       This can be seen in the following map, where the height of the extrusions show the number households with a weekly income of $650-$799 (the higher the extrusion the more households in the area), while the colours show the number of households with an income of over $4000 (with the brighter colours being where more households are).
       This comparison proves the theory of the 'latte line', and how people who don't understand or know as much English will earn less than those who understand English.

       <h2>Solution</h2>
       <br>
       <h3>The solution that I came up with was to make a learning centre for people with weak english to learn english. This learning centre would be ginormous and would be located in Ultimo, Sydney. I decided to locate the building in Ultimo as this area is in close proximity to the heart of Sydney.
       The learning centre is the shape of an egg with 'tentacle' like tubes/tunnels attached to itself and other areas of Sydney where people had weaker English. I decided to have tubes that reached out to Cabramatta, Bankstown, Hurstville, Parramatta, Strathfield, and Chatswood, as these suburbs are where there are more people who were not fluent in English, based on the dataset analysis in <a href="https://nelsonchen1999.github.io/CODE1230Assignment2/index.html">Assessment 2</a>. By doing so, it would be more convenient for people from these suburbs to travel to this learning centre.
       The inspiration of my design was that I wanted to create something sentient. I then had the idea of having tubes/'tentacles' reaching throughout Sydney transporting people who did not have strong English to this learning centre. This was when i thought of the 'Incredible 1' robot.</h3>
